# the repository. With every version signed by the same certificate, macOS recognises updates as
# the same app, so the Accessibility permission survives them.
#
# Run once from the release folder:   bash build/make-signing-cert.sh
#
# The certificate is self-signed: it proves "this is the same Quill as before", not who made it,
# so macOS still asks for "Open Anyway" when a new version is downloaded. Only a paid Apple
# Developer ID removes that.
